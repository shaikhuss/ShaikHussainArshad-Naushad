Game Particles:
Designed a project-specific memory scheme to group and reduce memory allocations of 15000 particles in a particle system, using the 
SIMD Instruction Set for faster Mathematical Operations and implemented the data structure Hot and Cold to help in cache hits (5X boost)

Multithreaded Audio Engine:
Audio Engine with 28 threads working concurrently to provide maximum performance

ZombieAI:
Programmed a survivor AI for a zombie survival game with the ability to aim, avoid enemies and navigate the map by implementing a "Hivemind" 
that evaluates the scene and assigns tasks to every AI agent based on the situation
